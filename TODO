* slist uses void* for type-erasure, but there are only three actual lists, and two have the same type.
  Ideally we would split this into two lists types. However, the editusers() function relies upon 
  the void* trick.

* it's often unclear whether we are looking at bytes (unsigned char),
  characters (int), or proper \0-terminated C strings, since they are drawn from the same
  buffer and the types overlap. Split them into distinct types.

* Add more const.

* the buffer sizes differ wildly. Maybe they should all be the same size?

* use the "n" variations such as snprintf(), strnlen(), etc.

* queue is only used for strings (urls and xmsgs). the implementation could be greatly simplified.

From the old TODO:

* Improve line editing a la GNU readline
* Make entire client thread-safe.  Major work but it has to be done.
