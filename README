This client is version 2.3.8 by IO ERROR, based on the ISCABBS client 1.5.1
(stdio patch) by Serendipity.  To build this client, see the appropriate
INSTALL file for your platform, and the client web page at:
			http://ioerror.bbsclient.net/

Quick Start:
    autoreconf --install
	./configure
	make
	make install


If you a clone from the repo (no configure script), then be sure you have the
latest autoconf/automake, etc.  TODO: explain how to get autotools for
various distros.

    ## Mac OS X:
    ## Install the developer command line tools from Apple.
    $ brew install automake autoconf

    ## remove all non-sources
    $ git clean -dfx

    ## this will create the configure script and its support files.
    $ autoreconf --install


If you are confused by autotools or dislike them, you are not alone.
Here's the bare minimum you need to know for this project:

   There are only two source files in the autotools setup.  configure.ac and
   Makefile.am  The remaining files are generated by autoreconf.

   Makefile.am isn't so bad. The names of the variables have special meaning to
   automake, so don't fuss with them. See the manual for automake.

   configure.ac is far more confusing and fragile. Best to avoid modifying it.
   It's where all the dislike stems from, and is where feature creep starts.
   Avoid adding more macros to it. See the manual for autoconf.
