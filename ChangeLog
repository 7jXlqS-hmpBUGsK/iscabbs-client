/* IO ERROR's ISCA BBS Client 2.3 is based on the stock client 1.5.1.

22 Mar 2001	Client 2.2.2 Released.

26 May 2001	Large changes to convert source code to use GNU autoconf.

26 May 2001	Minor fixup to longjmp(), changed to siglongjmp() on POSIX.
		Fixes a warning on FreeBSD.

27 May 2001	Client no longer remembers the name "Guest" for autologin.

27 May 2001	First time setup in Windows now presents as dialog boxes.
		This is a first step in making the client more "graphical."
		ANSI colors are no longer dim at logout or suspend.
		Titlebar is restored when resuming from suspend/new shell.

27 May 2001	Client 2.3.0 Released.

27 May 2001	Keymap UI has been removed.  The code for it is still in
		place and used to support new <O>ptions: use long who list
		by default, and use full profile by default.  These were
		about the only things people used the keymap for anyway.

27 May 2001	Added NEC SOCKS library.  It doesn't build under Cygwin
		so it is always disabled under Windows.  For now.

28 May 2001	GUI can now be disabled by the "textonly" .bbsrc parameter.

30 May 2001	Restored previous version of telinit() as the environment
		variables weren't being passed along.

 3 Jun 2001	OpenSSL support is implemented.  Unfortunately, I don't
 		yet have a BBS to test it against!

 3 Jun 2001	Client 2.3.1 Released.

 6 Jun 2001	Minor bugfix in OpenSSL code (missing #ifdef).  Thanks to
 		Jon Harms (http://www.mach-linux.org/) for finding this!

10 Jun 2001	Added General to the client config color menu, so that all
		text from the BBS can be re-colorized.  Also inputs can be
		re-colorized using the Input menu.  The color menus
		themselves have been cleaned up a bit.

11 Jun 2001	Client 2.3.2 Released.

23 Jun 2001	Fixed Bug 3: receiving an X message completely full of
		characters crashes the client when ANSI color is enabled.
		This bug affected non-ISCABBS systems with extended X
		message headers.

30 Jun 2001	Fixed bug with adding users to the friend list.  Nobody
		else seems to have caught this one...

10 Sep 2001	Modified Windows version to use rxvt in cygwin.

10 Sep 2001	Client 2.3.3 Released.

13 Oct 2001	One day after the last software release, the whole world
		changed.  I want to take a moment to mourn the needless
		loss of life which occurred on 11 September.

13 Oct 2001	Coded preliminary URL detection and browser spawning code.
		It more or less works, even with multi-line URLs.

13 Oct 2001	Client 2.3.4 Released.

12 Sep 2002	Add explicit support for configuring the background
		color, including transparent/default color support.
		Fix bug where transparent background would
		spontaneously change to black.

12 Sep 2002	Client 2.3.5 Released.

20 Oct 2002	Added support for automatic saved password.  This must be
		explicitly enabled with a ./configure option; it's disabled
		by default, and configure will print a nastygram warning of
		the dire consequences of using this feature.

20 Oct 2002	Add option to automatically answer the ANSI terminal
		question.

20 Oct 2002	Client 2.3.6 Released.

21 Oct 2002	Rename "macro" to "command" key; this should be a little
		more obvious as to what it actually does.

21 Oct 2002	Add option to configure browser and to run it in the
		background.  Now spawns using system() so no input should
		be received from the BBS while a text-only browser is
		running in the foreground.

21 Oct 2002	Cleaned up a whole bunch of compiler warnings (in -Wall).
		Didn't touch the warnings in the SOCKS library since it's
		all K&R C and I'm not going there today.

21 Oct 2002	Added a Unix man page.  It contains the complete client
		documentation as of this date.

21 Oct 2002	Disable linking OpenSSL by default since to the best of
		my knowledge no existing DOC-style BBSs currently support
		encryption properly.  That's why I couldn't finish writing
		the code.  There's no point in bloating the binaries.

27 Dec 2002	Client 2.3.7 Released.

 5 Jan 2003	Reset terminal to default parameters at logout.

27 Jan 2003	Rewrote parts of the automatic reply code, it now works
		properly when the correspondent has x messages disabled.

27 Jan 2003	Fix Win9x problem - use /cygdrive paths.  Now use bbsrc
		file in the Program Files directory rather than in C:\.

28 Jan 2003	Changed awaymsg to allow up to five full lines in the
		away from keyboard message.

28 Jan 2003	Client 2.3.8 Released.

 1 Feb 2003	Rewrote error messages to use GUI controls when available
		(helps greatly in debugging!)

 1 Feb 2003	Added code to search for a system default browser on Unix
		and to use ShellExecute to run the Windows default browser.

22 Oct 2003	Added check for -lresolv for Solaris.

 4 Nov 2004	Fix problem with glibc 2.3 and setjmp() which caused the
		client to lock up after the second time the editor was used.

20 Nov 2004	Allow black text to be chosen in color menus.

22 Nov 2004	Fix bug with removing the last user from the enemy list.

26 Nov 2004	Fix external editor on Windows. We now close the tempfile
		before starting the editor, then reopen it.

26 Nov 2004	Fix web browser on Windows. We now always start the
		system default browser.

27 Nov 2004	Client 2.3.9 Released.

 7 Feb 2005	Changed IP address due to ISCABBS IP address reassignment.

 8 Feb 2005	Client 2.3.9a Released.

17 Nov 2005	Remove bbs.iscabbs.info alias. Change it automatically to
		bbs.iscabbs.com.

17 Nov 2005	Client 2.3.9b Released.

26 Dec 2006	Updated IP address to reflect ISCABBS move off-campus.

26 Dec 2006	Client 2.3.9c Released.
