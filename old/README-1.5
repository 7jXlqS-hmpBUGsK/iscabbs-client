Following this line is the original README file distributed with the ISCABBS
client:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Here it is, the long-awaited ISCA BBS client!   Here's what you need to know:

1)  I (the author of this client, Serendipity on the ISCA BBS) will not support
    this client in any way, shape or form, and will not respond to requests
    from people wanting help in compiling, porting, hacking, modifying, fixing,
    using, etc. this client.  I do not have that kind of time.  As it is it
    provides a lot of useful functionality and works on a fairly large number
    of machines, if it does not do what you want or does not run on the kind of
    machines you have access to, I'm sorry, but I can't help you.

2)  This client is useless without a machine running VMS or Unix connected to
    the Internet.  If you are running Unix on your PC at home you'll need SLIP,
    PPP, or some other form of software that will put your machine on the
    Internet.  The exception to this is if you are running the program 'term'.
    See the INSTALL.term file for more.

3)  This software is distributed under the terms of the GNU Software License.
    Copies of that license are available at the FSF's main FTP site,
    prep.ai.mit.edu.

4)  For instructions on how to compile and install this software, see the file
    called INSTALL.unix for Unix systems, INSTALL.vms for VMS systems, or
    INSTALL.term for term.

5)  Once you have the client compiled and installed, read the helpfile called
    Client on the BBS, which gives information on the various helpfiles
    available detailing how to use all the client features.  You can, however,
    just run the client in place of telnet and have everything work exactly the
    same way it used using telnet.
