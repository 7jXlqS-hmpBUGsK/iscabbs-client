/* Original IO ERROR client based on stock ISCABBS client 1.5.0

Revision history:

19 Apr 95 - Initial rev.  X message autoreply implemented for "away
            from keyboard" applications.  Works 99% of the time.
20 Apr 95 - Kludged to set as not away when entering messages.
20 Apr 95 - 2.0.1 Released.
25 Apr 95 - Works with <Q>uestions, too.  Verified.
25 Apr 95 - Added Ctrl-N to paste the username from the most recently
            seen post or incoming X message.  This emulates the Ctrl-V
            function of other BBSs but is more flexible - works at
            any prompt that wants a user name.
25 Apr 95 - Added option to term support to notify sysops that this is
            a term-compiled client.
26 Apr 95 - 2.0.2 Released.
27 Apr 95 - Fixed a weird bug in the ANSI detection that caused some
            clients to seg-fault when reading an anonymous post, and
            other places.  I think.
27 Apr 95 - 2.0.3 Released.
27 Apr 95 - Added Isoroku friends list compatibility.
28 Apr 95 - 2.0.4 Released.
 4 Jun 95 - Fixed the infinite loop problem -- now suppresses automatic
            replies to automatically generated messages.
 4 Jun 95 - 2.0.5 Rushed out the door.
10 Jun 95 - Added modifications to the Makefile to generate a .tar.gz
            source file; and a "make dist" option for generating 
            those damned client binaries.
10 Jun 95 - 2.0.6 Released.
11 Jun 95 - Applied dbronder NetBSD patch.
12 Jun 95 - Fixed a problem in sysinfo.sh which caused the mail cmd to
            fail on some platforms.
14 Jun 95 - Fixed bug which caused "site" line in .bbsrc, as well as
            "shell" internal variable, to be corrupted.  Sheesh.
14 Jun 95 - Started work on a binary search function to speed up the
            who list.  I believe the meat of it works, and that alone
            should save a massive amount of CPU on the client system.
14 Jun 95 - Verified that ctrl-X bug is forcibly eliminated. :)
15 Jun 95 - 2.0.7 Released.
 8 Sep 95 - I haven't been keeping an accurate change log.  Many, many
            bugs have been fixed, and new stdio code from Serendipity
            has been added (it will appear in a future stock client,
            but you saw it here first!) which will make the transition
            to 2.1 much, much easier.  2.0.8 was released with some of
            the aforementioned fixes last week, along with a change to
            the ctrl-N function: it now scrolls back through the last
            20 names of X's or posts you've seen, removing duplicate
            names along the way.
?? Sep 95 - 2.0.9 Released.
?? Oct 95 - Alexander The Great patch released.  This should have been
            2.0.10; however, no new binaries were released.
 8 Nov 95 - Added "Ping on blank" option to allow X messages not to
            ping recipient if the new behavior is not desirable.
            (Blank X messages now cause the BBS server to ping the
            recipient.  We (optionally) override this by sending ABORT
            instead of a blank X message.  This is user configurable.
            For suppressed automatic replies, we always send ABORT.
 9 Nov 95 - 2.0.11 Released.
 9 Nov 95 - Fixed display bug in client config.
 9 Nov 95 - Possibly fixed VMS bug which caused the rc files to be
            hopelessly corrupted.
15 Nov 95 - Incorporated ANSI fixes from Serendipity (and fixed the
            errors in his patch).  This should cause captures to no
            no longer contain ANSI codes, and not allow a bbstmp with
            Esc (\033) in it to be sent to the BBS.
15 Nov 95 - Made aesthetic changes to client config.  Prompt appears
            slightly different, and "local" has been changed to
            "options."  The old keypress will work through 2.1, then
            will go away.  This change is to accommodate the addition
            of future client options, and to get users accustomed to
            the change before anything major is added.
15 Nov 95 - Added "+!R" recognition for reply suppression.  This is
            the first of the 2.1 "+!" command codes which will let
            copies of IO ERROR's ISCA BBS client talk to each other.
            Note that tthe client doesn't yet *send* "+!R".
15 Nov 95 - 2.0.12 Released.
30 Nov 95 - Fixed, finally and forever, the problem which was causing
            endless Segmentation faults for people receiving X
            messages.
30 Nov 95 - Added a #include <unistd.h> for BSD systems, I hope...
30 Nov 95 - 2.0.13 Released.
 4 Feb 96 - Removed the automatic ping feature, since it seems to be
            no longer needed.
 4 Feb 96 - Corrected the Web address in the banner.
 5 Feb 96 - 2.0.14 Released.
27 Feb 96 - Fixed typos, and the bug that was causing the compile to
            crash under VMS/Alpha.
27 Feb 96 - Added colorized friends list and support for forcing ANSI
            colors to be bold or non-bold.
28 Feb 96 - 2.0.15 Released.
25 Apr 96 - 2.0.16 (First Anniversary Commemorative Edition) released.
12 May 96 - Finished and debugged new I/O routines - basics, anyway.  Capture
            is now fully WYSIWYG - except MORE prompts are not captured.  This
            is normal and necessary for future features which parse long posts,
            who lists, etc., which might contain more prompts on screen, but
            the program won't be able to deal with them in the temp files...
            The routines are rudimentary at present and should be expected to
            expand dramatically in their functionality (though the API will
            hopefully remain the same).
12 May 96 - 2.0.17 Released in source form only.  I expect there are still
            bugs in the ANSI color handling, and I don't have access to an
            ANSI terminal... so we'll let everybody beta it.  :)
22 Jul 96 - Added the "Heinous" patch to allow connection to telnet daemons.
31 Jul 96 - Added login shell patch to allow the client to be run as a login
            shell.  This makes it create temporary files with its pid, rather
            than looking in a home directory (which probably it won't have).
31 Jul 96 - 2.0.18 Released.
14 Sep 96 - Fixed bug which caused the New shell feature not to work.
30 Sep 96 - Changed addresses in client banner.
30 Sep 96 - 2.0.19 Released.
11 Nov 96 - Fixed text parsing routines for changes made to the BBS server.
11 Nov 96 - 2.0.20 Released.
11 Nov 96 - Fixed enemy list in ANSI mode problem.
11 Nov 96 - 2.0.21 Released.
17 Nov 96 - Fixed the bug causing the old friend list to crash the machine.
17 Nov 96 - 2.0.22 Released in source code form only.
 7 Dec 96 - Added code allowing users to remap which keys send which commands
            to the BBS.  Added user interface at cck and moved cck to cch.
 7 Dec 96 - Modified system to always use net_putchar(). netput() now does
            key remapping as above before sending to the BBS.
 8 Dec 96 - 2.0.23 Released.
 8 Dec 96 - Fixed a potential problem with truncating keymap entries off the
            bbsrc file.
 8 Dec 96 - 2.0.24 Released.
13 Dec 96 - Fixed bug in code which caused VMS networking code to break.
13 Dec 96 - Implemented workaround for a bug in QVT/Net color handling.
15 Dec 96 - 2.0.25 Released.
23 May 97 - Changed compiled-in default BBS IP address to 128.255.95.69 to
            correspond with today's move of ISCABBS.
23 May 97 - 2.0.26 Released in source code and VMS binary form only.
16 Jan 98 - Added 'xland' function to automatically reply to x messages with
            'x' and the name of the recipient.  Numerous changes made.
