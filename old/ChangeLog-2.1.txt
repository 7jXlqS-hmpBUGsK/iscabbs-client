/* IO ERROR's ISCA BBS Client is based on the stock client 1.5.0.

 3 Oct 1998 -	Incorporated changes from Client 9/Blackout Group:
		* Unlimited size friend and enemy lists
		* Ctrl-P for backward name scroll
		* Alternate BBS site on command line
		* Restoration of OS/2 support (incomplete?)
		* .bbsfriends re-integrated into .bbsrc
		* New default macro keys
		* First-time setup for new features

		Bugs exist:  Automatic name matching doesn't yet
		work right with the full who list and has been
		disabled at this time.  VMS work to support the
		unlimited size friend/enemy lists and .bbsrc
		integration is not complete, so no VMS version
		of this client is yet available.

 3 Oct 1998 -	Client 2.1.0 Released as beta.  Documentation is
		not yet complete, and source still contains bugs.

 6 Oct 1998 -	Changed name of directory to client-2.1.  Fixed
		first-time setup to not offer the option to use
		or not use the new macro keys for a new install.

 6 Oct 1998 -	Client 2.1.1 Released as beta.

19 Oct 1998 -	Fixed bug in enemy list handling causing blank
		enemies to be written to bbsrc file.

19 Oct 1998 -	Client 2.1.2 Released as beta.
