To use the SOCKS package for crossing firewalls with the BBS client you need to
have the SOCKS package installed on your system.  It must be at least version
4.2beta in order to work properly with the BBS client.

Edit the Makefile to point SOCKS_LIB_HOME at the directory where the library
libsocks.a resides, usually this will be /usr/local/lib, which is what the
Makefile points to by default.  Then type "make socks" and a SOCKS-compliant
version of the BBS client will be compiled for you.
